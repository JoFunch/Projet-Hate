Instructions for code:

Simply run data.py in > python 3.5. The script will both
- initialise test-data, 
- preprocess data,
- instantiate model,
- train,
- print test accuracy, F1 and confusion matrix of the selected task,


Each subtask have each their respective .py file, respectively
They are found inside the Project Hate dir.
The immediate DKhate excel is the data used in the project. The data in the dkhate-dir is the original data, which for this project has been augmented / cleaned. 


Subtask A = Data2.py
Subtask B = DkHate B.py
Subtask C = DKHate C.py.

Inside each of the scripts are possibilities of running either LSTM and CNN. 
These must be Commented/activated in order to do so. By default the CNN will run.
